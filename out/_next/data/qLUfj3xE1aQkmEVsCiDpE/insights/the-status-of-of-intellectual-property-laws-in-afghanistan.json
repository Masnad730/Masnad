This natural wealth includes iron ore, precious metals and stones of numerous type, and strategic minerals such as Lithium (Li), and Uranium (U).  According to researches conducted, Afghanistan holds 1,500 types of natural resources, the majority of which comes with significant economic value.</p>\n<p>Afghanistan’s natural resources has many unique characteristics such as their are quality, physically located close to major cities of Afghanistan, and unlike most of natural resources sites of world, located much more closer to the earth’s surface which makes mining of these highly valuable resources easier, quicker, and of course much cheaper.</p>\n<p>Enactment of the new mining law, the existence of a suitable investment environment, and the Afghan government’s special efforts in facilitating mining contracts and rooting up corrupt administrative processes in this sector, are among other significant measures to encourage international investors to invest in the mining sector in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>The government of Afghanistan continues to add into these incentives and other necessary legal, and administrative reforms to increase the level of interest in this sector.</p>\n<p>As part of these efforts, the government of Afghanistan has also furthered survey efforts of the natural resources.  The experts working for the Ministry of Mining and Petroleum of Afghanistan, identified more than 1,400 sites holding large amounts of natural resources.  Some of these mining regions such as the Ainak cupper mine is the only mine of this type in the entire world.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in order to help foreign and domestic mining investors in Afghanistan, the Afghan geologists prepared and provided a complete natural map of Afghanistan that includes not only the mining regions but also the necessary excavation guides.</p>\n<p>Although according to Chris Fernot, a member of USGS, the mining companies face many challenges globally, including security threats, many mining investors look into whether a particular set of natural resources sites—that they are interested in—can be developed, and used to their maximum efficiency.  Therefore, the mining investors will have lesser investment obstacles in Afghanistan because on the one hand its government works hard to facilitate both the use, and developments of natural mines in Afghanistan, and on the other hand the government took specific measures to avert the existing and potential security threats.  For example, the Ministry of Interior of Afghanistan, provided a huge number of security forces to guard and protect the mining companies against security threats all over the country.  In fact, the ministry has created an entire structure of force tasked only with protecting Afghanistan’s natural resources sites, and the companies that are engaged in excavation of these sites.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it can be fairly concluded that Afghanistan has become a much better place for investment, and is a country with untouched valuable natural resources that has a vary high potential for any type of big or small investors in this sector.</p>\n","image":{"ID":239,"id":239,"title":"enviromental","filename":"enviromental.jpg","filesize":82340,"url":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/enviromental.jpg","link":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/masnad-insights/investment-in-afghanistans-untouched-natural-treasures/enviromental/","alt":"","author":"1","description":"","caption":"","name":"enviromental","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":238,"date":"2021-12-02

Investment Opportunities in Afghanistan"},"content":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","acf":{"description":"<p>The strong capacity in agriculture and its geo-economical location of Afghanistan has made this country famous for being the most fit for agriculture.</p>\n<p>According to the most reliable statistics, Afghanistan has 7.8 million hectares of agricultural land, only fifty percent of which is used.  Afghanistan further has 1.9 million hectares of natural forests and thirty million natural grazing lands.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Afghanistan is a mountainous country and is very rich in water reserves—a critical necessity of agriculture.  There are over 200 small and big rivers flowing from the vast chain mountains all over the country adding up to 75 billion cubic meters potable water.  Among these rivers, only three of them—the Kabul, Helmand, and Amu rivers—over 17 billion cubic meters of water flows within a year.</p>\n<p>Statistics indicate that the most important of the Afghan exports to the United States, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India and other countries are its agricultural products.  Afghan agricultural products constitutes the second biggest source of income with the first being precious stones export.  Among these agricultural products, the most are medical plants that brings home 20-22 million U.S. dollars.  The industry is still open for huge investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>It has to be said that Afghanistan’s agriculture sector is still unexplored, and has a high potential for investment.  There has not been remarkable investment in this sector, that does not content the high potential existing for investment in this sector.  For instance, the agro-farms built in Kabul, or the stocks built in Herat and other provinces cannot accommodate the vast demand present in this sector, indicating the need for more business and investment in agro-business.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, almost every type of fruits, grans, vegetables, and other agricultural products are produced in Afghanistan, but the country still lacks the ability to standardize producing these products and also produce more of its unique agro-products that are special to this country, such as seedless pomegranate, 64 types of grapes, and pine nuts (in Asia grows only in Afghanistan).</p>\n<p>Since, in recent times, an increasing number of domestic and foreign investors has indicated interest in investing in different sectors of investment in Afghanistan, the government of Afghanistan, has speeded up its efforts to encourage investment in the agricultural sector.  These efforts were strengthened ever more when Afghanistan became a member of the WTO, and the Agriculture development project was commenced by the USAID with a budget of 100 million U.S. dollars.</p>\n","image":{"ID":171,"id":171,"title":"a3","filename":"a3.jpg","filesize":71793,"url":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/a3.jpg","link":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/masnad-insights/agro-business-investment-opportunities-in-afghanistan/a3/","alt":"","author":"1","description":"","caption":"","name":"a3","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":170,"date":"2021-11-17
